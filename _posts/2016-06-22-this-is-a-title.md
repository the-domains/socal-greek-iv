  We are praying to see a Greek InterVarsity ministry on every campus that has a
  Greek System in Southern California. There is nothing more powerful than
  Greeks hosting faith conversations inside the fraternity and sorority houses.

We are praying to see a Greek InterVarsity ministry on every campus that has a Greek System in Southern California. There is nothing more powerful than Greeks hosting faith conversations inside the fraternity and sorority houses. 

We currently have ministry on half the San Diego Campuses and are on UCLA & USC in the Greater LA area. It was just a few years ago that we started Greek IV in Greater Los Angeles, so please contact us - we would love to help you get started on your campus! 

Below is a video of a student leader at UCLA talking about why he started ministry on campus and inside his chapter. Also, Kristina Crosetto, the founder of Greek IV on the West Coast, sharing about starting chapter ministry in San Diego.
