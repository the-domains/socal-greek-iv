  Row To Row is a new initiative we are starting at USC to engage Greeks with
  social justice and concern for the poor. USC is the closest campus to one of
  the most concentrated amount of homeless people in America, Los Angeles Skid
  Row. Row To Row is designed to take Greeks from Greek Row and get them serving
  on Skid Row. This semester we will be going down on Friday afternoons to play
  games and hang out with middle and high school kids.
